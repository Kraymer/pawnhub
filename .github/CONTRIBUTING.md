# Style guide

## Git commit message

Please follow the [Angular commit style](https://github.com/angular/angular.js/blob/master/DEVELOPERS.md#commits)

The Angular conventions demand to shape the commit message according to the following structure:

~~~
type(scope): subject

body
~~~

Common types:
- _build_: development changes related to the build system
- _ci_: development changes related to the continuous integration and deployment system
- _refactor_: development changes related to modifying the codebase, which neither adds a feature nor fixes a bug
- _style_: development changes related to styling the codebase, regardless of the meaning
- _test_: development changes related to tests 
- _docs_: documentation changes related to the project 
- _feat_: production changes related to new backward-compatible abilities or functionality
- _fix_: production changes related to backward-compatible bug fixes
- _perf_: production changes related to backward-compatible performance improvements
