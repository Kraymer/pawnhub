### Openings heatmap

Use the `--rw` flag to specify a lichess study as your repertoire with white pieces
(`--rb` for black).  
When doing so, games moves are colored to indicate when you deviated from your
repertoire lines.

Here, as white, user played an Italian game when‚Äîbased on his repertoire‚Äîhe was supposed to play a Scotch :

 
<div class="term-container"> ‚ôü  1  ‚ö∞Ô∏è   Hikaru      <span style="color: #4EFF0F;">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 </span><span style="color: #CC0002;">3. Bc4</span><span style="color: #4EFF0F;"> (d4)</span> Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4</div>


Gold color is used when it is your opponent that brings you into _the unknown_ :

<div class="term-container"> ‚ôü  1  üè≥    Danya      <span style="color: #4EFF0F;">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4</span></span><span style="color: #C4A000;">h6</span> 4. dxe5 g5</div>
