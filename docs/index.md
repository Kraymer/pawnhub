### Openings heatmap

```{note}
Note: [pgn-extract](https://www.cs.kent.ac.uk/people/staff/djb/pgn-extract/) is required to use the this feature.
```

Use the `--rw` flag to specify a lichess study as your repertoire with white pieces
(`--rb` for black).  
When doing so, games moves are colored to indicate when you deviated from your
repertoire lines.

Here, as white, user played an Italian game when‚Äîbased on his repertoire‚Äîhe was supposed to play a Scotch :

 
<div class="term-container"> ‚ôü <span style="background-color: #005F00;"> 1 </span> ‚ö∞Ô∏è   Hikaru      <span style="color: #005F00;">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 </span><span style="color: #CC0002;">3. Bc4</span><span style="color: #005F00;"> (d4)</span> Nf6 4. Nc3 Bb4 ...</div>


Gold color is used when it is your opponent that brings you into _the unknown_ :

<div class="term-container"> ‚ôü <span style="background-color: #005F00;"> 1 </span> üè≥    Danya      <span style="color: #005F00;">1. e4 e5 2. Nf3 Nc6 3. d4</span></span> <span style="color: #C4A000;">h6</span> 4. dxe5 g5 ...</div>

### Searching

Use the `-s` option to select games to display based on a specific query.
Indicate on which field to search, followed by the value to match (eg `-s eco:A00`).  
In most cases, skipping the field to search on whole game data is shorter and produce same results (eg `-s A00`).

Below the existing fields and enumeration of their possible values :

| Field       | value                                              |
| ---         | ---                                                |
| eco         | ECO code from `A00` to `E99`                       |
| eco_name    | eg _Benko Gambit_                                  |
| moves       | eg _e4 d5 exd5_ ...                                |
| opp_name    | Opponent name                                      |
| result      | `W` (win), `L` (loss), `D` (draw)                  |
| termination | `timeout`, `resigned`, `checkmated`, `abandoned`   |
| website     | `chess.com`, `lichess.org`                         |
| white       | `0` (no), `1` (yes)                                |
